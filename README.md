üëã Hi there! My name is Arshvir Chaudhary and I am a software engineer from Toronto. 

üéì At the moment, I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Through the co-op program, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work and learn at several different companies:
- Cardea Health Inc as a Software and Data Engineer where I worked on automating false positive checks and conduct data extractions and verification for clients .
- Roadpost Inc as a AWS Software Developer where I leveraged several AWS services to build an event-driven Mailchimp integration.
- Surf as a Product Development Intern where I worked on refactoring and automating scripts to streamline development workflow.
- WE Accelerate Program as a SEO consultant where I worked to redesign a website and optimize it for SEO.

üè° For the summer term, I will be returning to Cardea Health Inc for my fifth Co-op term. If you're interested in working with me, please let me know since I am looking for an opportunity for my 6th co-op term which can be either in the Fall or Winter.  

‚õ≥ In my free time, you can probably catch me running and training for a marathon, playing some hockey, reading a book or walking my dog.
